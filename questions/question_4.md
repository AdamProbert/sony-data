# Question 4 - Feedback!

I found this test satisfying to solve! There were some interesting problems, especially in Part C of Question 3.

Question 1 I found to be subtly tricky. At first glance, I only spotted one or two problems with the SQL but every time I went back to look at the query I spotted something else. I feel Question 1 does a good job of evaluating the breadth of SQL knowledge required for this role. I'm also interested to find out what I missed!

Question 2 did a good job of evaluating my ability to break complex code down into manageable pieces. I enjoyed having to work out what the input file format was, this added a good amount of extra complexity. I had some difficulty trying to get zsh to interpret tab characters though, perhaps a different delimiter could be used as I don't believe this was an intended complexity.

Question 4 was particularly challenging, especially regarding the 20-minute session definition. I found once I got my head around the concept of this it came together quite quickly.
Perhaps an example here demonstrating this definition would help future candidates grasp the concept faster.

Coming away, I'm hopeful the type of work I could be presented with at Playstation reflects this level of challenge!
